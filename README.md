Application Name: Hash Table  App

Introduction of Hash Table 
                      The application provides the following functionalities:
add: Adds a key-value pair to the hash table.  Keys are strings, and values are integers.
get: Retrieves the value associated with a given key.
remove: Removes a key-value pair from the hash table.
list: Displays all key-value pairs in the hash table.
exit: Exits the application.

Describe the Hash Table 
	This application serves as a practical demonstration of hash table data structures.  It reinforces understanding of their use in storing and retrieving data efficiently.  It's designed for educational purposes to illustrate core concepts.
 
Why did you make that kind of application and How does it contribute to you or to the community?
	This project contributes to my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.  Building this application allows me to apply theoretical knowledge practically and gain experience with core Java concepts.  It enhances my problem-solving skills and strengthens my ability to implement efficient data structures.
